## Azure Identity & Authentication Labs

This repository contains a series of hands-on labs focused on Azure identity, authentication, and access management. The labs are designed to help build practical troubleshooting skills commonly required in technical support and cloud identity roles.

The exercises are based on real-world scenarios such as users being unable to sign in, MFA issues, Conditional Access blocks, authentication method problems, and policy conflicts. Each lab includes steps to reproduce the issue, investigate it through the Azure portal, and apply the correct fix.
